## Project : 
This is the main repository for the HackBio'2020 Virtual Internship Experience.

## Goals
* Make this documentation neat and nice. (Novice Friendly)
* Complete task 2 (multiple languages)
* Make a simple bash script for git commit

## Language check
- [x] Python
- [x] Julia
- [x] C++
- [ ] R 
- [ ] Java
- [ ] MATLAB
- [ ] Javascript 
- [ ] C

Note: The checklist has 8 languages right now. The minimum required amount is 7. If it is not satisfied, please choose unchecked languages from a list. 

#### I am not a coder, what should a choose?
Everyone began from something (: Actually the language in this task doesn't matter, as the script is very simple.
You can search smth similar to "write hello world script in *language_of_interest* ".

If all of the languages are checked, and the requirements (about programming language variety) are satisfied, you are free to choose whatever language you like. A good start is to become more familiar with R or Python. Both of these languages are extremely popular within the bioinformatics community. See templates for "Hello world script" for [R](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hello-world-in-r-programming/) and [Python](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello,_World!).

## Unified template for output
Human text is an excellent example of unstructured data. Desired fields (for this task) can be printed out in many different ways. Therefore I propose a unified template for your script output:

>NAME: *Your full name* <br>
>E-MAIL: *Your e-mail* <br>
>USED LANGUAGE: *Name of used scripted language. All letters are capital* <br>
>BIOSTACK: *Name of biostack you chose. The only first letter is capital* <br>
>SLACK USERNAME: @+*username* <br>

An example:

>NAME: Pavlo Hrab <br>
>E-MAIL: pavlo.hrab@lnu.edu.ua <br>
>USED LANGUAGE: JULIA <br>
>BIOSTACK: Genomics <br>
>SLACK USERNAME: @pavlo <br>

**After you get the desired output, please name your file _stage_0_slack-username_ <br> An example:** 
>stage_0_pavlo.jl <br>
